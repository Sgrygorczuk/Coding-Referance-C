|V| is the number of vertecies inside of a graph 
|E| is the number of edges insdie of a graph

There are some special kind of edges in graph

An one edge is called a self loop, it happens when you have one
vertecie. 

Multiedge or parallel edge where two vertieces are connected by two 
edges that travel in the same direction. 

If there are no self loop or mulitedge then the graph is considered a simple graph. 

Let's say  we have a grpah with four edges 

V = {V1,V2,V3,V4}

And therefore the number of edges we have is 

|V| = 4;

However we don't connect any of these edges thus 

E = NULL

And 

|E| = 0;

However if we were to draw a directed graph with all vertiecs having an
edge to all the other edges we'd have |E| = 12. 

Thus if |V| = n, then 0<= |E| <= n(n-1). 

Transalting that into english. If you have n number of vertieces 
the number of edges you can have is between 0 and n (n-1). So in our 
case With |V| = 4 we can have between 0 <= |E| <= 4(4-1) ==  0 <= |E| <= 12. If directed. 

For an undriected graph the equation become 

0 <= |E| <= n((n-1))/2

Walk:
a sequence of verteces where each adjectent pair is connected by an edge.
So looking at 7.2 Grpahc a posslibe path could be V1->V2->V6->V8. This path will be represnted as 

<V1,V2,V6,V8>

Path:
A path or a Simple path if no vertieces (and thus no edges) are repated in a walk. 

Another path we could have would be 

<V1,V2,V6,V8,V5,V2,V1,V4>

In this path two vertieces and one edge is repated. 

A Trail is a walk in which no edges are reapted. 

A closed walk is walk where it starts and ends at the same vertex. 
The lenght of a path is the amount of vertecies. 

A Cycle or a simple is a closed walked with no reption other than the start and end vertex.
