Graphs are a collection of nodes of vertieces. No rule connetion. 

Graph: 
A Graph G is an ordered pair of a set V of verteixes and 
a set E of edges, which is an ordered pair and is represtend as this 

			G = (V,E)

V is the first of the pair and E is the second object in the pair

			(V,E) != (E,V)

Look to 1._ Graph iamges the vertices are represented as 

V = {V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8}

What is an edge? 

Edge is identifed as a representation of it's two inputs.

There are two types of way edges. Where there is the directed which only allows travel in one direction
edge 1._ Graph Edge and the undirected edge which can travel in either way. In the directed edge we have 
our origin and the other point would be the destion, the origi is U and the destination is V. 

This can be represted as 

		(u,v)

And since it is order we can't just go back you have to add a new path from V to U.
That path would then in turn be represtend as 

		(v,u)

How since they are diffrent paths 

		(u,v) != (v,u) 

On the other hand a undriected edge dosen't require a seocnd path to travel back 
and forth between the two vertieces and can be represtends as 

		{u,v} 

Which is also equivalent to itself 

		{u,v} = {v,u}

Knowing that we can look at our graphs and say that it is an undirected graph and we 
can define the endges as 

E = {{V1,V2} , {V1,V3}, {V1,V4}, {V4,V7} , {V4,V8}, {V7,V8},
     {V2,V5} , {V2,V6}, {V5,V8}, {V6,V8}}

Sometimes all connections cannot be created equal. And thus we have weighted grahs. We give the
lenght of the edge a weight which represnet it's distance making it a weighted graph. With this one can
set a travel disntace as a best choice and a worst choice. So supposing you want to travel from A to D, 
if this was a non weighted graph you could travel A->E->D which would be shortest by vertieces. However,
in a weighted graph going A->B->C->D is shorted since their length is less thand the path previously mentioned.
